# Spring Demo app with Docker multi-stage build

### Run

You can pass build arguments when building a Docker image as follows:
```
docker build --build-arg artifactid=spring-demo --build-arg version=0.0.1 -t spring-demo .
```

You can omit all of them as they have the same default values defined un the `Dockerfile`.
So you will get the same result when building a shorter version:
```
docker build -t spring-demo .
```
